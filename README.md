# Janus

![Janus login page](/documentation/login.png)

An issue and requirements tracker for development and maintenance of products and services, focusing on the entire life cycle.

**_NOTE:_** From **wikipedia**: In ancient Roman religion and myth, Janus (/ˈdʒeɪnəs/ JAY-nəs; Latin: Ianus [ˈi̯aːnʊs]) is the god of beginnings, gates, transitions, time, duality, doorways, passages, frames, and endings.

It will contain support for teams, product owners and single individuals tasks to maintain the product or service.

## Status
The project is in an early design and startup phase. It started 2022-06-06 and is currently working on a first sprint of the system design that will contain early sketches of the solution, information model and user interface to get started.

The first code has been created with a fully working RBAC security solution and form authentication that allows you to login based on users in the database and their roles. It also has language and session support via client side cookie. It is just the rest of the application now ;-)
